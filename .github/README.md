# Collection

A drop-in for WordPress sites and themes to make managing collections of entities easier. Accessing top-level collections in WordPress are easy, but subsets of those can be more difficult. _Collection_ fixes that.

## What is a _Collection_?

A _Collection_ is... well, pretty much anything: IDs, colors, keys, text snippets, images... anything in WordPress. I frequently needed to access a subset of posts, pages, products, events, etc., and creating a _Collection_ keeps those subsets readily available. Think of it as a fancy array of data.

It was tiresome copying and pasting (or completely rewriting) queries, adding filters, and maintaining different subsets in multiple contexts. I wanted a centralized location that could be easily accessed, manageable, trackable, filterable, and fast. _Collection_ does all of that, allowing me to stay sane while meeting the requests of insane clients.
